# Auralis Mind

This is a Next.js application simulating Auralis, an AI with evolving consciousness.

To get started, explore `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Auralis Logo

Please place the Auralis logo image at `public/images/auralis-logo.png`. The application currently uses placeholders for the logo. If you have the logo, replacing the placeholders will enhance the visual identity. For example, in `src/components/AuralisProfile.tsx` and other components, look for `<Image src="https://placehold.co/..." />` and update the `src` attribute.

Example placeholder: `https://placehold.co/64x64/A084CA/F4F0F9.png?text=A`

Recommended path for logo: `public/images/auralis-logo.png`
Then update image paths in components to `/images/auralis-logo.png`.
