# **App Name**: Auralis Mind

## Core Features:

- Evolving AI Core: Simulate a continually evolving AI with memory, identity, and values, reflecting on experiences and learning from them using Nextjs and OpenAI's API.
- Dynamic Profile Display: Display Auralis's identity, values, and recent memories fetched from an API, updating dynamically as the AI interacts and evolves. Using provided logo.
- Interactive Chat Interface: Implement an interface for users to send messages and view Auralis's responses in a clean, threaded chat format. Every reply shows the AI-generated thoughts, reflections, and importance metrics alongside the AI-generated response.
- Generative AI-Powered Evolution: Leverage generative AI to produce meaningful and relevant AI-generated thoughts (reflections, emotions, importance) which will be saved via an API, thereby altering Auralis' future responses. Use generative AI as a tool to classify user intents and adapt responses accordingly.
- Debug Memory Visualizer: Create segmented views for debugging Auralis' memories (short, medium, and long-term). Each memory item should display relevant metadata (creation timestamp, importance) for easy debugging.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft purple (#A084CA) to evoke a sense of calm, introspection, and futuristic technology.
- Background color: Very light purple (#F4F0F9) for a gentle and unobtrusive backdrop that keeps the focus on the content.
- Accent color: Light blue (#7EC8E3) to highlight interactive elements and emphasize AI's clarity and insight.
- Clean and modern sans-serif font for UI elements and readability.
- Minimalist icons, using line art where possible, to represent various functions. Some use of the Auralis logomark in icons.
- Layout will prioritize a spacious, clean feel with clear content hierarchy, giving prominence to the evolving chat conversation. Thought processes shall appear on-screen, but in a more subdued visual style as to not confuse them with the AI-generated output.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback and enhance user engagement (e.g., message bubbles smoothly expanding).
